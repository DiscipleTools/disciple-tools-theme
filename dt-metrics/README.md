# DT-Metrics
The DT-Metrics module handles all the collection and presenting of system statistics. It is the chief location for
building reporting for the critical path from other parts of the system.


## Critical Path
### Prayer
Prayer Network is a total of people engaged through multiple channels.
1. __Email__ _(MailChimp, iContact, etc.)_ This is the current total of people subscribed to the email list. This does not factor the number of emails sent.
1. __Social Media__ _(Facebook, Twitter)_ This collects the current total of people who have 'liked' or 'followed'. This does not factor 'reach' or 'page views'.
1. __Website__ To track a website as a source for the prayer network, there needs to be a user registration. Website visits are not counted.
1. __Mobile App__ (aspirational) We hope to produce a mobile app that allows people to track and respond with prayer to new contacts and group starts.
1. __SMS/Texting__ _(EZTexting, etc)_ Texting list subscribers.
