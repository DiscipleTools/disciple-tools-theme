# Libraries

Libraries folder is where we host a few external libraries and bundle them into Disciple Tools.

Note that some libraries are found in other folders, for instance,
`dt-core/admin/multi-role` and others.


# Copyright and licensing

Developers, before adding any libraries, make sure its license is compatible
with GPLv2+, and list the library in the `LICENSE` file. Also make sure to
include the library's license file.
