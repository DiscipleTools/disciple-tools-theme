# Disciple.Tools
Disciple.Tools software boosts collaboration, clarity, and accountability for disciple and church multiplication movements.

## Description
As a contact relationship management (CRM) system it is :

- unique – able to track and organize individuals or groups generationally
- insightful - giving end-to-end dashboards, charts, and maps on contacts, baptisms, groups, churches, and movements
- secure – restricting database access based on permission levels and specific assignments
- federated - designed to host how and where you want and inter-link instances as desired
- scalable – relevant for individuals, groups, or movements
- customizable – highly adaptable through settings, built-in modifications, external plugins, and  requiring low-tech skills
- multilingual  – translatable, facilitating cross-cultural collaboration
- mobile-friendly - giving full-functionality from a mobile device
- free and open source – created in the WordPress environment and improved by a volunteer community on Github (https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools)

The commit team will shape the development of Disciple.Tools, and is currently implementing generational mapping, a mobile app with offline use, and people group tracking.

## Purpose
There needs to exist a simple, low-cost, highly distributable CRM that is tailored to the process of using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements. Most CRM solutions are too expensive to be used by small volunteer teams, and they often require significant configuration and development to implement. This project is attempting to make a rapid launch, low cost system that is tailored for movements.

## Platform
We are building on the Wordpress platform because of its open-source availability, simplicity of installation, numerous low cost hosting options, multi-lingual support, substantial configurability and customization, giant development community and resources, native REST API, mobile readiness, and healthy market place for distributing themes and plugins.

- Select the `Add New` button at the top of the screen.
- Then select the `"Upload Theme` button at the top of the screen.
- Use the `choose file` button to find the disciple-tools-theme.zip file you saved in step 1, and upload that file and wait for Wordpress to install it.

### Step 4
- Once uploaded, you will see the new Disciple.Tools Theme installed with other themes. Next `Activate` the theme.

Done! You now have a complete coalition management system for your movement.
