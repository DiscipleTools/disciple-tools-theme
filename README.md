# DMM-CRM
A contact relationship management system for discipleship making movements.

###Description
DMM CRM is a contact relationship management system (CRM) specially designed to support outreach projects using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements (DMM).

###Purpose
There needs to exist a simple, low-cost, highly distributable CRM that is tailored to the process of using digital marketing to accelerate disciple making movements (M2DMM). Most CRM solutions are too expensive to be used by small volunteer teams, and they often require significant configuration and development to implement. This project is attempting to make a rapid launch, low cost system that is tailored for movements.

###Platform
We are building on the Wordpress platform because of its open-source availability, simplicity of installation, numerous low cost hosting options, multi-lingual support, substantial configurability and customization, giant development community and resources, (soon to be) native REST API, mobile readiness, and healthy market place for distributing themes and plugins. 

###How to Install
The goal of the project in incredibly simple and fast launch of the DMM CRM system. Below are the simple steps to do that. The files here are the complete theme folder.
>Warning: The DMM-CRM is best installed on a fresh Wordpress installation. The DMM-CRM system will make a complete transformation of the Wordpress site, so it is not recommended to be used on an existing site or one that has any mission critical information.

##Step 1
- Download theme .zip file from the DMM-CRM project page (https://github.com/ChrisChasm/DMM-CRM). 

##Step 2
- Login to your Wordpress site. (Note: New installations are highly recommended) 
- Open "Appearance > Themes" from the Admin menu. 

##Step 3
- At the top of the Themes page, select the "Add New" button.
- At the top of the "Add New" screen, select the "Upload Theme" button. 
- Upload the .zip file you just downloaded in Step 1.

##Step 4

You now have a complete digital marketing to disciple making movement system. Enjoy!
