Recommendations
The most important missing features to implement in the theme version are:
Duplicate checking/merge functionality - This is a critical feature for data quality
Source and Assigned To fields - Important for data tracking and ownership
Example CSV files - Helpful for user guidance
Enhanced automatic field detection - Improves user experience
The theme version has successfully recreated most of the core functionality with some architectural improvements (like using the dt_reports table instead of transients for better persistence), but these missing features would make it more complete and user-friendly.
